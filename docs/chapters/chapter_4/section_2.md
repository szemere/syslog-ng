One of the easiest ways to contribute to the development of syslog-ng
is to participate in the discussions about features, bugs and design.
Some of these discussions started on the
[mailing list][ar:mailing-list], some in the
[issue tracker][ar:issue-tracker]. Bugs tagged
[`help`][ar:issues:help] are generally good targets to contribute your
feedback - but pretty much any open issue can be a good start!

We use [waffle.io][ar:waffle] as our story board, to prioritize issues
and guide the development. Use this interface for browsing existing
issues and pull requests.

If you find a bug or request a feature you should create an issue for it.
There is no ultimate form for an issue but some basic ideas should be taken
to consideration. 

#### Common bulletpoints
* short, informative sentences
* references to docs, other issues
* picture (1 picture tells more than a 1000 sentences)

#### Bulletpoints of an issue about...

##### Bug
* short description of the phenomenon
* configuration and architecture example to reproduce it
* longer description of the bug (references to the documentation why you think itâ€™s a bug)
* possible explanations, ideas about the root cause

##### Feature
* short description of the request
* use-cases (why do you think it worths implementing)
* some ideas if you have any about how to implement the feature,
what should be taken to consideration
