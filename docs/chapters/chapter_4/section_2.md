One of the easiest ways to contribute to the development of syslog-ng
is to participate in the discussions about features, bugs and design.
Some of these discussions started on the
[mailing list][ar:mailing-list], some in the
[issue tracker][ar:issue-tracker]. Bugs tagged
[`help`][ar:issues:help] are generally good targets to contribute your
feedback - but pretty much any open issue can be a good start!

We use [waffle.io][ar:waffle] as our story board, to prioritize issues
and guide the development. Use this interface for browsing existing
issues and pull requests.
